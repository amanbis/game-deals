# poke-angular
A simple webapp built with AngularJS in conjunction with [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) and the [Pok√©api](http://pokeapi.co/). The main material components I used were [toolbar](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/toolbar), [autocomplete](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/autocomplete), and [cards](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/card). I also wrote a configurable factory to retrieve data from the API.

There do seem to be some issues with the autocomplete element losing input focus as well as some animations not working at all. If you have any suggestions/critiques, please send them my way =).
